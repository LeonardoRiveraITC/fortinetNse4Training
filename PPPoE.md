The **Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet** (**PPPoE**) is a [network protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol "Network protocol") for [encapsulating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking) "Encapsulation (networking)") [Point-to-Point Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol "Point-to-Point Protocol") (PPP) frames inside [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") frames. It appeared in 1999, in the context of the boom of [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSL "DSL") as the solution for [tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol "Tunneling protocol") [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet "Network packet") over the DSL connection to the [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP "ISP")'s [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") network, and from there to the rest of the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). A 2005 networking book noted that "Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption"), and [compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression "Data compression")."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet#cite_note-Boney2005-1) Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, via the [PAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Authentication_Protocol "Password Authentication Protocol") protocol or via [CHAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-Handshake_Authentication_Protocol "Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol"). PAP was dominant in 2007 but service providers have been transitioning to the more secure CHAP, because PAP is a plain-text protocol.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet#cite_note-GoldenDedieu2007-2) Around 2000, PPPoE was also starting to become a replacement method for talking to a modem connected to a computer or [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)") over an Ethernet [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN "LAN") displacing the older method, which had been [USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB "USB"). This use-case, connecting routers to modems over Ethernet is still extremely common today.
